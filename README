planned todos/features:

- rubrik, in der alle fotos angezeigt werden, die seit dem letzten login hochgeladen wurden
- paperclip interpolation for storage of images: something planned like private/<username>/<datum>/...
- media bulk upload
- css hover icons
- implement more detailed access management:
-- roles (cannot be altered at runtime, users can each have 1 role):
--- admin (can do everything, maybe some kind of 'sudo', also rights of user and guest)
--- users (can create own folders with media, also rights of guest)
--- guests (users that are not logged in)
-- groups (can be altered at runtime, users can each have multiple groups):
--- when creating a folder, the owner can set which users can view the folder (and comment on its media)
--- this can be: none (i.e. restricted to owner only), individual users, predefined group of users (e.g. "family", "friends", ...), all (i.e. world-wide readable)
