planned todos/features:

- section, which shows all media that has been uploaded since the last login
- paperclip interpolation for storage of images: something planned like private/<username>/<datum>/...
- media bulk upload
- css hover icons

bugs:

- user which belongs to role administrator cannot access everything
- editing media inside folders messes them up
